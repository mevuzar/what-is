The strongest rain ever recorded in India shut down its capital.

The purpose of this is to analyze how I parse the sentence and into what structure.

* {[com.whatis.samples.indian_rain.meta_lang.The strongest rain][ever recorded in com.whatis.samples.indian_rain.meta_lang.India][shut down its capital]}
*
* Chronology of parsing:
* 1. 'The' (subject_declaration_hint)  -> understands the subject is coming

* 2. 'strongest' (subject_descriptive_declaration) [Most][Powerful] -> since 'strongest' is descriptive I know it's a descriptive declaration and
*    keep reading awaiting an object

* 3. 'rain' (location_bound_sentence_hint)  -> got the noun but:
*                              a. surely, a specification part(which strongest rain exactly) will follow
*                              b. I guess the sentence is a 2 part pattern of [[subject_descriptive_declaration] [specification]][remark]

* 4. 'ever' (specification) -> could stand alone since  but does does not much any usual/inteligent syntax so I continue expecting the specification complement

* 5. 'recorded' (complementary_segment)  -> I know this is a part of the specification since 'ever recorded' is a known combination
*                               but I also know another accuration complement
*                               is likely to follow

* 6. 'in' (necessarily bound complement segment)(location_hint) -> 'in' does not stand alone in any case so I expect another fragment. 'in' hits a location
*    since rain is a natural, geographically bound phenomenon.

* 7. 'India' (complement)(last_complement_segment_hint)[Country] -> since rain is geographically bound, 'India' is most likely to be the last complement.

* 8. 'shut' (remark) (occurrence_description) (verb) (damage_hint) -> 'shut' doesn't stand alone in any case so I expect another fragment.
*                                     damage hint since rain can damage and shut_down happens in many cases when damage is done.

* 9. 'down' (verb_end_hint) (seconday_subject_hint) -> the term 'shut down' is usually bound and final.
*                                                         only an additional verb should postpone the seconday_subject

* 10. 'its' (possessive_back_reference)
*           (secondary_subject)
*           (possessive_object_hints: (last_object_in_sentence)(logical_association)) -> the last object until now is 'India'.
*                                                                        this helps in associating the possessive pronoun 'its' with com.whatis.samples.indian_rain.meta_lang.India
*                                                                        but there's a more important hint - you cannot 'shut down' a rain.
*                                                                        let's take the following example:
*                                                                        com.whatis.samples.indian_rain.meta_lang.The strongest rain ever recorded in com.whatis.samples.indian_rain.meta_lang.India, biggest country in asia, shut down its capital.
*                                                                        com.whatis.samples.indian_rain.meta_lang.In this example only the logical_association hint helps us here since the
*                                                                        last_object_in_sentence hint would have suggested that the rain shut down Asia.
