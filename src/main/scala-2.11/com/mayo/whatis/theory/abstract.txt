* WhatIs intends to convert sentences to meanings which are describable by a computer(machine illustrative).
  The definition of success for that matter would be that personA writes something which a computer can read, convert then illustrate to personB.
  The conversion should include the tagging of this illustration as deterministic or non deterministic.
  The conversion is done by dismantling the phrase to its logical components - those are built from atomic entities(such as You(which extends Someone and Person), Your(which holds Posession and extends You with AbstractPerson))
  These components are called "associations"

* Once I broke the phrase down and converted it to meanings,
  WhatIs is supposed to be able to convert the same phrase and I'm supposed to be able to assemble a
  new phrase out of the same meanings(or part of them) using meta_lang

* In order to achieve the above capacities, we analyze phrases; each of which has a sample and a correlating Playground.scala console app.
  Every such phrase contributes to WhatIs' knowledge of how does my brain decifer phrases into meanings by enrihcing GENERAL RULES per each language.

* Sometimes (e.g. "poetic phrase" sample), the sentence is not complete but for humans it is reduced to an abstract meaning: a description of an event.

* The lowest common denominator of associations which makes a meaning is the abstract trait: Meaning



Q: This event is a kind of a scene. are all events scenes?
